            IpAddressClaim allows to claim a NetBox IP Address from an existing Prefix.
            The IpAddressClaim Controller will try to assign an available IP Address
            from the Prefix that is defined in the spec and if successful it will create
            the IpAddress CR. More info about NetBox IP Addresses:
