            IpRangeClaim allows to claim a NetBox IP Range from an existing Prefix.
            The IpRangeClaim Controller will try to assign an available IP Range
            from the Prefix that is defined in the spec and if successful it will create
            the IpRange CR. More info about NetBox IP Ranges:
